## Futher Testing
I tested this webiste on 
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge 

The Webiste was tested on multiple screen sizes including...
* Iphone 11
* Iphone 12
* Samsung Galaxy s22 Ultra
* Ipad
* Ipad Air
* Desktop screen 32" (Msi Mag 32")
* Desktop Screen 27" (Msi Mag 27")
* Desktop Screen 25" (Samsung G4)

Testing was done to ensure proper funcitionality of the site across multiple screen sizes. 

## Fixed Bugs 
* Navbar wasnt collapsing properly on phone screens fixed by adding correct JS to end of code.
* Footer was not compressing how i wanted it to, adding container elements and unique CSS targeting allowed me to fix this.
