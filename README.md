## Imagery
[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) : Pexels images have been used in the project to show staff, dishes and hero image.

* Hero Image:

![hero](https://github.com/Aaronnnpf/restaurant-project/blob/main/assets/images/hero.webp "Hero image")

This image was chosen to represent the smell of home cooking when you walk in the door of the resturant.

* Icon:

![icon](https://github.com/Aaronnnpf/restaurant-project/blob/main/assets/images/icon.webp "Icon image")

Identifies the cuisine type (Italian) very straight forward.

### Staff portraits 

I chose to put staff portraits in so that user can familiarise themselves with the staff they will meet upon arrival, Allowing for a more relaxed approach as they know who is who and helps them feel more like family adding to the overall experiance.

* Bartender:

## Futher Testing
I tested this webiste on 
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge 

The Webiste was tested on multiple screen sizes including...
* Iphone 11
* Iphone 12
* Samsung Galaxy s22 Ultra
* Ipad
* Ipad Air
* Desktop screen 32" (Msi Mag 32")
* Desktop Screen 27" (Msi Mag 27")
* Desktop Screen 25" (Samsung G4)

Testing was done to ensure proper funcitionality of the site across multiple screen sizes. 

## Known bugs
* My image sizes are to big and impact the performance of my site.
* My book now button redirects without the required table being filled out on booking page.

## Fixed Bugs 
* Navbar wasnt collapsing properly on phone screens fixed by adding correct JS to end of code.
* Footer was not compressing how i wanted it to, adding container elements and unique CSS targeting allowed me to fix this. 
* H3 was used instead of h2 causing performance issues, changed to h2 lead display 6.
* Colour contrast issue on my hero image with h1 and h2 to fix i added an opaque background to better the contrast and increase performance and accesibility. 

## Testing User Experience (UX)
* First time customer goals
1. As a first time customer, easy navigation is a must so i can see what is on offer on the website.

* Upon entering the site i can see that there is an easy to use navbar on all devices on mobile that being a dropdown and on desktop or tablet that being link tabs at the top. 

* The Dolce Vito logo remains in the left corner when on page and is also a clickable link back to the home page.

* The home page has an intro paragraph giving  me a brief summary of who they are, where they are from and what there inspiration is.

* The home page also shows off some speciality dishes so a quick galance i can recognise what i would or would not like.

* The About section is 2nd on the list and very clear againt the background on the drop down menu, This allows me to find out more about the staff and who they are.
